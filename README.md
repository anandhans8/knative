# What is Knative?
Knative (pronounced kay-nay-tiv) extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components that are essential to build modern, source-centric, and container-based applications that can run anywhere: on premises, in the cloud, or even in a third-party data center.

### Knative components
```
Serving for rapid deployment and autoscaling of serverless containers
Eventing for loosely coupled, event-driven services
Build for painless code-to-container-in-a-registry workflows.
```
